            Growing up, I am the youngest out of all my siblings.
            <br>People always assume that I am the most spoil since I am the youngest, but that's not true.
            <br>Seeing all my siblings grow up, I try my best to not follow their footsteps and learn from all there
            mistakes.
            <br>
            <br>I am not one of your typical Hmong women.
            <br>I love my culture and embrace who I am as a Hmong woman, but I can't follow the footstep of a Hmong
            woman.
            <br>One of the reasons is that I am Hmong-American. Growing up in Wisconsin, Milwaukee, my world expanded in
            the community I grew up.
            <br>I love that I grew up in Wisconsin, Milwaukee because here in Milwaukee the cultures are so diversere,
            and it amuses me because everyone was so different from me.
            <br>
            <br> People say different is bad, because different to me, means change.
            <br>Change is bad to most because of not knowing what to expect.
            <br>I embrace different/change.
